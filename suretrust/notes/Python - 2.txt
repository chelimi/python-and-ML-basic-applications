Problem Statement:

Design and develop a comprehensive To-Do List Manager program using Python that incorporates various fundamental topics of the language. The program should allow users to create, view, modify, and manage their to-do lists efficiently. The To-Do List Manager should cover the following Python topics:

1. File Handling: Implement file handling operations to store and retrieve to-do list data persistently. The program should allow users to save their to-do lists to a file and load them for future use.

2. User Input Handling: Enable users to interact with the program through a user-friendly command-line interface. Implement input handling mechanisms to accept user commands, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and displaying the to-do list.

3. Data Structures: Utilize appropriate data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, to organize and manage the to-do list data effectively. Each task should consist of a title, description, and status (complete/incomplete).

4. String Manipulation: Implement string manipulation techniques to process and format task data. Allow users to input task details, update task information, and display the to-do list in a readable format.

5. Control Flow: Utilize control flow structures (if-else statements, loops) to create logical flow within the program. Use conditional statements to handle user commands, validate inputs, and execute appropriate actions based on the user's choices.

6. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle potential errors or invalid inputs gracefully. Ensure that the program provides meaningful error messages and allows users to recover from errors without crashing.

7. Functions: Break down the program's functionality into modular functions to promote code organization and reusability. Use functions for tasks such as adding a task, deleting a task, marking a task as complete, and displaying the to-do list.

8. Exception Handling: Implement exception handling to handle unforeseen errors or exceptional scenarios. Catch and handle exceptions to prevent program crashes and provide informative error messages to users.

9. User Authentication: Optionally, implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own separate to-do lists. Provide a user registration mechanism and password authentication to ensure data privacy.

10. Sorting and Filtering: Enhance the to-do list manager by incorporating sorting and filtering capabilities. Allow users to sort tasks based on their title, completion status, or creation date. Enable filtering tasks based on their completion status or specific criteria.

Your task is to design and implement a To-Do List Manager program that incorporates the mentioned Python topics. The program should provide a user-friendly interface, handle user input gracefully, ensure data persistence, and demonstrate good programming practices, including modularization, error handling, and code clarity.

Note: The program should be implemented as a command-line application without requiring a graphical user interface (GUI).
