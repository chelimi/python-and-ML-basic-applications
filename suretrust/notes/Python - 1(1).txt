Design and develop a Python program that emulates a comprehensive quiz application covering all major topics in the Python programming language. The program should present users with a series of multiple-choice questions and provide immediate feedback on their answers. The quiz should encompass a wide range of Python concepts, including but not limited to variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, lists, dictionaries, classes, and file handling.

The program should have the following features:

1. User Registration: Users should be able to register with unique usernames and passwords to access the quiz.

2. Question Bank: The program should maintain a question bank that includes a diverse set of questions from various Python topics. Each question should have multiple options, with only one correct answer.

3. Randomized Quiz: The program should generate a random set of questions from the question bank for each user attempting the quiz. The number of questions should be configurable.

4. Scoring and Feedback: The program should calculate and display the user's score at the end of the quiz. It should provide immediate feedback on each question, indicating whether the chosen answer was correct or incorrect.

5. Time Limit:(Optional), the program can include a time limit for each question or for the entire quiz, where users need to complete the quiz within the given timeframe.

6. Quiz History: The program should maintain a history of users' quiz attempts, including their scores and timestamps. Users should be able to view their past quiz results.

7. User-Friendly Interface: The program should have a user-friendly and intuitive interface, allowing easy navigation and interaction with the quiz.

Your task is to develop a Python program that implements the above features, ensuring accurate question selection, scoring, and user feedback. The program should demonstrate good programming practices, such as modularization, error handling, and code reusability.
